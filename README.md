## Voluntary-Involuntary-Liens
### Both involuntary and voluntary liens significantly impact property titles.

### **Involuntary Liens**

---

#### **Definition**  
An **involuntary lien** is a claim placed on a property by a creditor or government authority without the owner's consent, usually as a result of unpaid debts or legal judgments.

---

#### **Importance in Title Search**  
1. **Impacts Title Marketability**:  
   - An involuntary lien must be resolved or addressed before the property can be sold or refinanced.  
2. **Legal Obligations**:  
   - Ensures that any unpaid obligations tied to the property are settled.  
3. **Title Insurance**:  
   - Title insurers review these liens to exclude unresolved ones from coverage unless addressed.

#### **Types of Involuntary Liens**

1. **Tax Lien**:  
   - **Definition**: Imposed by the government for unpaid taxes, such as property tax or income tax.  
   - **Example**: A homeowner fails to pay $5,000 in property taxes; the local government places a lien on the property.  
   - **Effect on Title**: This lien must be cleared before a clean title transfer can occur.  

2. **Judgment Lien**:  
   - **Definition**: Resulting from a court decision requiring the property owner to pay a debt.  
   - **Example**: A creditor sues for unpaid debts and wins a judgment, which attaches to the debtor's property.  
   - **Effect on Title**: Title search identifies the lien, and it must be satisfied to avoid legal complications in property transactions.  

3. **Mechanic’s Lien**:  
   - **Definition**: Filed by contractors or workers for unpaid labor or materials used to improve the property.  
   - **Example**: A contractor is unpaid for a $20,000 renovation project and files a lien.  
   - **Effect on Title**: Lien may delay the sale until payment is made or resolved legally.  

4. **Child Support Lien**:  
   - **Definition**: Placed against the property of an individual who owes unpaid child support.  
   - **Example**: A parent with $10,000 in unpaid support faces a lien that attaches to their home.  
   - **Effect on Title**: Must be settled before the property transaction can proceed.  

---

#### **Resolution**  
- **Payment or Settlement**: The debt is paid in full, and a release of lien is recorded.  
- **Dispute and Remove**: If the lien is unjust, legal action may be taken to dispute and remove it.

### **Voluntary Liens**

---

#### **Definition**  
A **voluntary lien** is a legal claim placed on property with the owner’s consent, often used to secure financing.

---

#### **Importance in Title Search**  
1. **Planned Obligations**:  
   - Identifies mortgages or loans that are part of the property’s financing.  
2. **Clear Title Verification**:  
   - Ensures that voluntary liens are paid off or accounted for in the sale.

#### **Types of Voluntary Liens**

1. **Mortgage Lien**:  
   - **Definition**: A lien placed by a lender when a property is used as collateral for a loan.  
   - **Example**: A homeowner secures a $300,000 mortgage to buy a property.  
   - **Effect on Title**: The lien remains until the loan is paid off; it’s recorded in the title and disclosed during a title search.  

2. **Home Equity Loan Lien**:  
   - **Definition**: A lien for a loan taken against the equity in a property.  
   - **Example**: A homeowner borrows $50,000 against their home equity for renovations.  
   - **Effect on Title**: Recorded in the title and must be settled before sale or refinancing.  

---
